    "##### Abstract: \n",
    "American funding agencies such as the NIH set postdoctoral salary guidelines that are constant across the United States.\n",
    "However, the cost of living across university cities and town varies widely.\n",
    "Here we investigated the extent to which postdoctoral salaries account for these cost-of-living differences.\n",
    "We analyzed the incomes of 30,000 F1B postdoc salaries across universities. \n",
    "We find that the real (cost of living adjusted) income of postdoctoral researchers follows an inverse trend with other incomes in the same regions. \n",
    "Despite a small increase in income in high cost-of-living areas, real postdoctoral incomes in the 20 largest metropolitan regions are worth X\\% less (N 2020 dollars) yearly than the median real income. \n",
    "Top-ranked universities are disproportionately affected by this location-based wage-gap. \n",
    "Real incomes in the top 20 US institutions account for an N\\% decrease in real income (N 2020 dollars) relative to the median. "

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Choices made during the postdoctoral period of training have long lasting impacts on researcher's career outcomes. \n",
    "For example, doing a postdoc after completing a PhD provides an advantage in finding tenure-track academic positions [[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00221546.2013.11777287) but results in long-lasting salary reductions when leaving academia [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766).\n",
    "When persuing an academic career, many interrelated factors impact future career prospects. \n",
    "Institutiional prestige plays an important role in placement: 25% of universities produce 71-86% of all tenure-track faculty hires and only 9-14% of faulty find positions at universities more prestigious than their doctorate [[3]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005). Faculty placements are increasingly dependant on fellowships and career development awards, which are unevenly distributed across institutions [[4]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223876). \n",
    "The mentorship provided by postdoctoral advisors also plays an large role future career outcomes [[5]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/355511v1.full.pdf). Postdocs have little or no control over other important factors in their career placement and workplace satisfaction however, such as gender[[6]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/355511v1.full.pdf) [[9]]((https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abd1996)), race [[8]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0013189X19831006) [[10]\n",
    "](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412416/), parenthood [[9]]((https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abd1996)), and socioeconomic roots [[7]](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6wjxc). A goal of the many academic instritutions is to reduce and remove such systemic inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Postdoc positions are generally considered to be transitory periods between training and finding a permenant academic position. Academic funding agences suggest a maximum postdoc length at around five years. \n",
    "In the biomedical sciences, the duration of an average postdoc is around 4.5 years [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766), slightly less than the 5-7 year probationary period on the tenure track.\n",
    "Even beyond these training years however, the financial impact of doing a postdoc on salary carries over at least 15 years following PhD completion [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the financial impacts of doing a postdoc are long lasting, salary can be disregarded when trainees are choosing a postdoc. Funding guidelines set by agencies, such as the NIH, set standards for postdoc salaries that are constant across universities. The value of that income can vary greatly across the United States however.\n",
    "Cost of living is not taken into account when setting NIH postdoc salaries which often impose restrictions and limits on universities on how income can be supplemented.\n",
    "Because many high-prestige universities are located in higher cost-of-living areas and university prestige plays an important role in academic career projections, if the effective income of postdocs are lower in high-prestige universities, a lower effective salary has the potential to disproportionately impact researchers who cannot absorb the short-term impacts of a lower postdoc income, such as parents and people from disadvantaged socioeconomic roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This work explores how income differs between postdocs when factoring in the cost-of-living across geographical regions. We find that, despite small differences in postdoc salaries, real income of postdocs in higher cost-of-living areas is X% (2020 dollars) lower in the quartile of postdocs living in the highest cost-of-living areas than quartile of postdocs living in the lowest cost-of-living areas. This effect is the opposite of the general trend in the same regions, where per capita real income is higher in higher cost-of-living areas such as cities. \n",
    "This effect is especially prominant in top-tier universities. We find the median postdoc in 16 of the top 20 Times Higher Education ranked US institutions makes a lower effective income than the median postdoc income (mean X% Y 2020 dollars)."

    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a dataset of X postdoctoral salaries acquired from H1B postdoctoral hires between 2013 and 2020 reported by the US Department of Labor. We adjusted salaries for inflation across years to 2021 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then adjusted postdoc salaries to the \"real income\" based upon the Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) that the university resides within. \n",
    "Each year, the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases the Region Price Parity (RPP) across US geographical regions, which measures the difference in price levels weighting rents, food, transportation, housing, recreation, education, medical, apparal and other expenditures [FIGURE RPPS MAP]. Using the RPP, the BEA then estimate the Real Personal Income across the same geographical regions, which is a price-adjusted regional income. We applied the same transformation to postdoc salaries for each university to estimate the real postdoc income. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Salaries are lower in high cost of living areas\n",
    "- Salaries are higher in more expensive areas, however real income is lower. \n",
    "- the opposite effect is observed in the per capita real income for the same areas. \n",
